# Hifide — Agentic Coding Desktop App (Electron + React)

Hifide turns a familiar chat UI into a local, tool-using coding assistant. It runs as an Electron desktop app with a React renderer, integrates tightly with your filesystem, and (optionally) uses an embedded terminal, AST-aware structured edits, and repository indexing to help you build and refactor faster.

Status: core chat + streaming via OpenAI is stable. Terminal, structured edits, and indexing are in active development or behind feature flags. See docs for details.


## Key Features
- Chat-first developer experience with streaming responses and cancel support
- Provider-agnostic orchestration with adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini
- Local tool integrations (policy-gated)
  - Filesystem read/write with explicit diff previews and user approval
  - Embedded terminal sessions (PTY) with allow/deny policies [experimental]
  - Structured code edits powered by TypeScript/ts-morph [experimental]
- Optional local project indexing + retrieval for large repos [experimental]
- Secure API key storage in the OS keychain via keytar
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, and Linux


## Architecture (brief)
- Renderer (React + Vite): chat UI, editor panes, notifications, settings
- Main (Electron): provider streaming, IPC orchestration, secure key storage, tool execution
- Preload bridge: curated APIs exposing fs, llm, secrets, and terminal to the renderer
- Orchestrator: provider-agnostic agent loop with tool-calling policies and planning

More details: docs/architecture.md and docs/retrieval.md.


## Requirements
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+ (via Corepack)
- macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Provider API keys as needed (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini)

Enable pnpm with Corepack if needed
- corepack enable
- corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate


## Installation
1) Clone the repository
- git clone <your-fork-or-ssh-url>
- cd hifide

2) Install dependencies
- pnpm install

## Quick Start
- pnpm dev
- In Settings → Providers, add your API key(s)
- File → Open Folder… to select a workspace
- (Optional) Settings → Agent & Tools: enable Filesystem write, Terminal, Structured edits
- (Optional) Settings → Indexing: enable local indexing for large repos
- Start a chat. Ask the agent to inspect files or propose changes, then review and apply diffs


## Development
- Start the app in development mode
  - pnpm dev
  - Launches the Vite dev server and Electron (via vite-plugin-electron). The renderer hot-reloads on changes.

- Lint the project
  - pnpm lint

- Preview the built renderer (web-only)
  - pnpm preview

Tip: The first launch may prompt for OS permissions (keychain access, terminal). Use View → Toggle Developer Tools to inspect logs.


## Build & Package
- Create a production build and platform package
  - pnpm build
  - Outputs: dist/ (renderer), dist-electron/ (main/preload). electron-builder produces installers under release/.


## Provider Configuration
Configure providers in Settings (recommended) or via environment variables when launching from a terminal. Saved keys are stored securely in the OS keychain (keytar).

- OpenAI
  - Env: OPENAI_API_KEY
  - Models: gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, o3-mini, etc.
  - Notes: streaming and tool/function calling are supported

- Anthropic
  - Env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - Models: Claude 3.x family
  - Notes: tool usage via orchestration adapter

- Google Gemini
  - Env: GOOGLE_API_KEY
  - Models: Gemini 1.5/2.x
  - Notes: tool calls mapped via adapter layer

If both env vars and saved secrets exist, the saved secret usually takes precedence.


## Agent Mode: Tool-Calling and Structured Edits
Agent Mode lets the assistant call local tools during a conversation. You control which tools are enabled and the confirmation level.

- Filesystem tools
  - Read: fetch file contents and directory listings for context
  - Write: propose precise edits and show a unified diff for approval before applying
  - Scope: restricted to the selected workspace; binary files are ignored

- Terminal tool [experimental]
  - PTY-backed shell (node-pty + xterm) inside the app
  - Uses: run tests/linters/builds, quick scripts
  - Policy: disabled by default; opt-in per workspace; confirmations for risky commands

- Structured edits [experimental]
  - AST-aware refactors using TypeScript and ts-morph
  - Safer large changes: symbol renames, import updates, function/class insertions with type-correct signatures
  - UI: preview and accept/reject per-file diffs

Enable/disable under Settings → Agent & Tools.


## Local Indexing and Retrieval [experimental]
Scale to large repos by indexing locally and retrieving just-in-time context.
- Indexer: parses files, extracts symbols, embeds chunks, and builds a dependency graph
- Storage: local vector store with metadata
- Usage: enable in Settings, choose folders, let indexing complete, then ask questions; the agent retrieves relevant snippets automatically
- Privacy: indexes stay local to your machine

See docs/retrieval.md for design and roadmap.


## Terminal Risk Policy
Running shell commands from an agent is risky. Hifide applies layered safeguards:
- Default: terminal tool disabled
- Explicit opt-in per workspace
- Guardrails: allow/deny lists, timeouts, and exit code checks
- Confirmation gates for destructive or network-affecting operations (e.g., rm -rf, git push, publish)
- Audit trail: per-session command history

See docs/architecture.md for design and policy gates.


## TypeScript Refactors with ts-morph [experimental]
When Structured Edits are enabled, the agent can:
- Rename symbols across files and update imports
- Insert/move functions and classes with correct types
- Update interfaces and types and propagate changes
- Generate codemods with previewable diffs

Edits are proposed first; you approve individual files or the entire change set. See docs/implementation-plan.md for validation loops (lint/tests/build before/after).


## Keyboard Shortcuts
- Cmd/Ctrl+Enter — send message
- Esc — cancel streaming response
- Cmd/Ctrl+K — focus chat input
- Cmd/Ctrl+/ — toggle command palette (if enabled)
- Cmd/Ctrl+S — apply approved edits (when diff view is focused)

Shortcuts may vary by OS and feature flags.


## Troubleshooting
- Keytar install/build errors
  - Ensure native build tools are present (Windows: Desktop development with C++; macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools)
  - Clear and reinstall: rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install

- node-pty or other native deps fail to build
  - Ensure Python 3 and a C/C++ toolchain are available
  - On Windows, set the VS version if needed: npm config set msvs_version 2022

- Blank window or renderer crash
  - Open DevTools (Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+I) and check terminal logs
  - Try disabling GPU: ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=1 ELECTRON_DISABLE_GPU=1 pnpm dev

- Provider 401/permission errors
  - Verify API keys in Settings; confirm env vars if launching from a terminal
  - On corporate networks, set HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY if required

- electron-builder packaging issues
  - Delete dist/, dist-electron/, and release/, then re-run pnpm build
