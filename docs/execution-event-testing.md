# Execution Event System - Testing Guide

## Overview

The execution event system has comprehensive test coverage across three levels:
1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components (event emitter, adapter)
2. **Integration Tests** - Test provider event emission
3. **Scheduler Tests** - Test event routing to store handlers

## Test Files

### 1. Unit Tests (`execution-events.test.ts`)

**Location**: `electron/ipc/flows-v2/__tests__/execution-events.test.ts`

**What it tests**:
- `createEventEmitter()` - Event emitter creation and metadata injection
- `executionEventToLegacyCallbacks()` - Migration adapter
- Event flow integration

**Key test cases**:
```typescript
âœ“ should create an emitter that adds metadata to events
âœ“ should handle tool_start events
âœ“ should handle tool_end events
âœ“ should handle tool_error events
âœ“ should handle usage events
âœ“ should handle done events
âœ“ should handle error events
âœ“ should convert chunk events to onChunk callback
âœ“ should convert tool events to callbacks
âœ“ should maintain event order
âœ“ should handle multiple executions with different executionIds
```

**Run tests**:
```bash
pnpm test execution-events.test.ts
```

### 2. Provider Integration Tests (`execution-events-integration.test.ts`)

**Location**: `electron/providers/__tests__/execution-events-integration.test.ts`

**What it tests**:
- All three providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini) emit events correctly
- Events include complete metadata (executionId, nodeId, provider, model, timestamp)
- Tool events include unique toolExecutionId (UUID)
- Event order is consistent across providers

**Key test cases**:
```typescript
Anthropic Provider:
  âœ“ should emit chunk events with complete metadata
  âœ“ should emit tool events with toolExecutionId

OpenAI Provider:
  âœ“ should emit chunk events with complete metadata
  âœ“ should emit tool events with toolExecutionId

Gemini Provider:
  âœ“ should emit chunk events with complete metadata

Cross-Provider Consistency:
  âœ“ should emit events in consistent order across all providers
```

**Run tests**:
```bash
# Replay mode (uses saved fixtures, no API keys needed)
TEST_MODE=replay pnpm test execution-events-integration.test.ts

# Record mode (makes real API calls, saves responses)
TEST_MODE=record pnpm test execution-events-integration.test.ts

# Live mode (always makes real API calls)
TEST_MODE=live pnpm test execution-events-integration.test.ts
```

**API Keys Required** (for record/live modes):
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Anthropic tests
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For OpenAI tests
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For Gemini tests

### 3. Scheduler Event Routing Tests (`scheduler-events.test.ts`)

**Location**: `electron/ipc/flows-v2/__tests__/scheduler-events.test.ts`

**What it tests**:
- Scheduler correctly routes events to store handlers
- All event types are handled (chunk, tool_start, tool_end, tool_error, usage, done, error)
- Event parameters are passed correctly to store methods
- Complete event flows work end-to-end

**Key test cases**:
```typescript
Chunk Event Routing:
  âœ“ should route chunk events to feHandleChunk
  âœ“ should handle multiple chunk events in order

Tool Event Routing:
  âœ“ should route tool_start events to feHandleToolStart
  âœ“ should route tool_end events to feHandleToolEnd
  âœ“ should route tool_error events to feHandleToolError
  âœ“ should handle complete tool lifecycle

Usage Event Routing:
  âœ“ should route usage events to feHandleTokenUsage

Done Event Routing:
  âœ“ should route done events to feHandleDone

Error Event Routing:
  âœ“ should route error events to feHandleError

Complete Event Flow:
  âœ“ should handle a complete LLM request flow
```

**Run tests**:
```bash
pnpm test scheduler-events.test.ts
```

## Running All Tests

```bash
# Run all execution event tests
pnpm test execution-events

# Run all tests with coverage
pnpm test --coverage execution-events
```

## Test Coverage

### Current Coverage

**Unit Tests**: âœ… Complete
- Event emitter creation
- Metadata injection
- Legacy callback adapter
- Event ordering

**Integration Tests**: âœ… Complete
- Anthropic provider event emission
- OpenAI provider event emission
- Gemini provider event emission
- Tool execution ID generation
- Cross-provider consistency

**Scheduler Tests**: âœ… Complete
- Event routing to store handlers
- All event types covered
- Complete flow scenarios

### Coverage Metrics

Expected coverage:
- **execution-events.ts**: 100% (all functions tested)
- **Provider event emission**: 90%+ (core paths tested)
- **Scheduler event routing**: 100% (all event types tested)

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Use Fixtures for Provider Tests

Provider tests use the fixture system to avoid making real API calls during CI:

```typescript
await withFixture(
  'anthropic-chat-simple',
  async () => {
    // Test code here
    return { events }
  },
  testMode
)
```

### 2. Verify Complete Metadata

Always verify that events include all required metadata:

```typescript
expect(event).toMatchObject({
  executionId: expect.any(String),
  nodeId: expect.any(String),
  timestamp: expect.any(Number),
  provider: expect.any(String),
  model: expect.any(String),
  type: expect.any(String)
})
```

### 3. Verify Tool Execution IDs

Tool events should include unique UUIDs:

```typescript
expect(event.tool?.toolExecutionId).toMatch(
  /^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i
)
```

### 4. Test Event Order

Verify that events are emitted in the correct order:

```typescript
const eventTypes = events.map(e => e.type)
expect(eventTypes).toEqual(['chunk', 'chunk', 'usage', 'done'])
```

## Debugging Tests

### Enable Verbose Logging

```bash
DEBUG=* pnpm test execution-events
```

### Run Single Test

```bash
pnpm test execution-events.test.ts -t "should create an emitter"
```

### Inspect Event Payloads

Add console.log in tests to inspect events:

```typescript
events.forEach(event => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(event, null, 2))
})
```

## CI/CD Integration

Tests run automatically in CI using replay mode (no API keys needed):

```yaml
- name: Run execution event tests
  run: TEST_MODE=replay pnpm test execution-events
```

## Future Test Additions

### Phase 3 Tests (After Legacy Callback Removal)

Once legacy callbacks are removed:
1. Remove adapter tests
2. Add tests for direct event emission
3. Verify no fallback logic exists

### Performance Tests

Add tests to verify:
- Event emission doesn't block provider streaming
- Large event volumes don't cause memory issues
- Event routing is fast (<1ms per event)

### Error Recovery Tests

Add tests for:
- Provider errors during streaming
- Network failures
- Malformed events

## Summary

The execution event system has **comprehensive test coverage** across all three levels:
- âœ… Unit tests verify core functionality
- âœ… Integration tests verify provider behavior
- âœ… Scheduler tests verify event routing

All tests pass and are ready for CI/CD integration! ðŸš€
